## Presentation Materials for my "Sound Analysis with the Fourier Transform and Python" OSCON Talk.

To run anything, you must use this command to run ipython notebook: **ipython notebook --pylab inline**

The presentation notes are all in the form of iPython Notebooks.  You can either:
* Install all of the dependencies and run them yourself locally
* Or you can view the ipython notebooks in read-only mode by opening the Index.html


## Python libraries used:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* ipython
* scikits.audiolab

(NOTE: To install a number of these libraries, there are underlying C dependencies.)
